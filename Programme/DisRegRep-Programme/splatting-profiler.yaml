# The affinity mask under consideration constitutes an exemplar of a system endowed with an 8-core CPU and a SMT ratio of 1:2 (i.e. 8 cores/16 threads). It is noteworthy that this system is devoid of any energy-efficient cores, whilst the SMT threads are grouped in adjacent configurations. It is imperative to ascertain the CPU topology of one's system to determine the optimal affinity mask.
